 ## Environment Settings
 .
 - **ENDURA_BATCHER_AUTOFLUSH**: true/false (default: false)
 - **ENDURA_LOG_LEVEL**: level of logging (default: info, cli supported)
 - **ENDURA_LOG_FILE**: save logs to this file (default: undefined, cli
 supported)

 supported)
 .
 ## ADDITIONAL CHECKS:
 .
 - Inventory of libraries being used
 .
 ## ISSUES
 .
 ### ISSUE: only "/usr/bin/endura" is authorized to access the socket
 .
 ### ISSUE: who is authorized to invoke "/usr/bin/endura"?
 .
 - is there authentication? unclear how to ensure secret not exposed to other
 processes
 -> as long as the secret is not exposed as a global env, but job specific,
 should be fine
 - maybe define a list of authorized processes (in no order) all the way up the
 chain?
 -> different from path_exec in that we go beyond just 3 levels to our max
 (currently 8; which can be exploited)
 -> could be enforced at the userspace level
 - maybe do both of the above?
 -> a solution to this would still mean declaring path_exec for /usr/bin/endura
 necessary?
 - this strategy prevents someone from SSHing in and just killing the process
 .
 ### ISSUE: likely need an "overwrite" policy
 .
 - assume github actions and the demo app
 -> runner is based on node (is this actually true?)
 -> npm install run by node
 -> node can write to anything in workspace
 - where is the "git clone" equivalent in the server logs?
 -> ANS: events were lost due to starting job before server ready
 .
 ### QUESTION: musl threading performance issues
 .
 - see:
 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/testing-alternative-c-memory-allocators-pt-2-musl-mystery-gomes/
 - adopt mimalloc? already implemented. no metrics to assess impact!!
